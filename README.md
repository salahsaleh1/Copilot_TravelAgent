# TravelAgent
Agent which will help users in booking flights/hotels/rent a car


TravelAgent Copilot is chatbot designed to help user to book flights/hotels/rent a car. 
It uses Microsoft Copilot Studio to develop Copilot and uses advance Generative-AI capabilities to assist users in booking.

In this chatbot we used:
- SharePoint lists to store data.
- PowerAutomate to retrieve data from SharePoint.
- Actions in Copilot Studio to call PowerAutomate Flow.
- Carousel Adaptive Cards to display flight details.
- Variables in CS to store data.
- Global Variables to pass values between topics in CS.


In this step we are getting flights between given two cities.
